<!-- modrinth_exclude.end -->

Modern Minecraft Java client relies on Netty to connect to multiplayer servers,
and this simple mod is able to proxy Minecraft server traffic through designated SOCKS proxy as desired.

## Features

- SOCKS proxy support. Explicitly proxy Minecraft server traffic.
- Convert SOCKS proxy to HTTP(S) proxy. Proxy communications with Mojang Yggdrasil auth service, player skin download endpoint, and server resource pack downloading.
- Remotely resolve Minecraft server's domain name through SOCKS proxy with the help of [DNS over HTTPS (DoH)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8484)

## When to/Why should use this mod?

- You have a better network route through a proxy and want to lower your ping as much as possible.
- You have trouble accepting server resource pack because it's hosted on a provider that's blocked in your residence.
- You care about your privacy.

## Dependency

Based on Fabric. Just drop mod jar in mods folder, and voil√†!

- In addition, you probably want [Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config/version/11.1.106+fabric) to have convenience adjusting configuration.
- [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu/versions?g=1.20.1&l=fabric) is suggested.

## How to use?

Before you start, drop mod jar in mods folder, and launch game! (Assume you have Cloth Config API as well.)

- Open this mod's config screen (whether via ModMenu or buttons in the multiplayer screen)
- In "General settings" section, turn on "Use proxy". Choose SOCKS proxy version your proxy accepts. (SOCKS5 is highly recommended. SOCKS4 is pretty old.)
- Fill in host address, port number to your proxy. Should authentication be in demand, fill in username and password field. (SOCKS4 wants username field only)
- Hit save button. Done. This mod will try to reopen communication with Mojang Yggdrasil auth service, so you may pass verification upon joining servers through proxy.

## Upgrading

**This mod is in early development! Breaking changes will be introduced at any time. You are advised to backup your config file before upgrading!**

Navigate to your game's directory (usually `.minecraft`), open `config/socksproxyclient` and make copy.

## FAQs

### Where/How to get this mod?

There are currently several approaches:

- Clone this repository and compile by executing `./gradlew build` on *nix or `./gradlew.bat build` on Windows.
  After successful compilation, navigate to `build/libs` directory under the project root directory.
- Navigate to [Actions section](https://github.com/CrimsonEdgeHope/SocksProxyClientOfMinecraft/actions),
  open the latest successful workflow run and download artifacts. (Artifacts will eventually expire. Compilation approach is preferred)
- Turn to [GitHub releases](https://github.com/CrimsonEdgeHope/SocksProxyClientOfMinecraft/releases) and download jar there.

Choose the jar with "SNAPSHOT" suffix.

#### CurseForge?

Planning. (Perhaps not. Will see.)

#### Modrinth?

Planning.

#### (Other third-party Minecraft mod distribution platform)?

Currently, no.

### 1.x.x (major version) Forge/Fabric/Quilt/NeoForge please?

Maybe. I personally don't really have much time. Developing multiplatform mod (and backporting) is painful as hell,
I need to learn.

Fork for your own version, or open a PR.

### Fabric API required?

This mod doesn't declare Fabric API as a dependency, so it's a No. But you better have it.

FabricLoader 100% required.

### Fabric server applicable?

No. This mod is client-side.

### Compatibility with (mod name) mod?

Depends. Should be compatible as long as (mod name) doesn't mess up with the part where Minecraft handles network connection.

As such, this mod won't be compatible with [Proxy Server](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/proxy-server)
and [RespectProxyOptions](https://modrinth.com/mod/respectproxyoptions).

**Currently, this mod isn't 100% compatible with [ViaFabricPlus](https://modrinth.com/mod/viafabricplus). Use at own risk!**

### Will this mod ever be allowed on (server name)?

Look, you, as a simple Minecraft Java player, just want a nice game playing (fairness of course)
or have privacy protected, such desire is 100% acceptable.
You don't want to play on a server under 400+ ping through a shitty ISP network route.

Also, all code is open source, take a look in it if concerned.
Besides, having a VPN yeets out this mod because your VPN software will take care of every bit of traffic for you.

Still unsure, consult server admin then. 
If, unfortunately, (server name) explicitly forbids proxy (or it's pay-to-use-proxy), then issue stands at their side.

### How to see if this mod is actually working?

It will print logs when:

- Pinging a Minecraft server. (Unless you have explicitly turned off the proxy setting.)
- Joining and playing on a Minecraft server. (Unless you have explicitly turned off the proxy setting.)
- Game client makes communications with HTTP(S) servers, including:
Mojang Yggdrasil auth service, player skin download endpoint, server resource pack downloading, DoH servers.
(Unless you have explicitly turned off their proxy settings.)

So what will those logs look like?

Communications with **Minecraft servers** will look like this:
```text
[00:00:00] [Netty Client IO #1/INFO] (SocksProxyClient) Using Socks5 proxy /127.0.0.1:1080 on mc.hypixel.net/209.222.115.58
[00:00:00] [Netty Client IO #2/INFO] (SocksProxyClient) No proxy on host localhost/127.0.0.1
```

Communications with **HTTP(S) servers** will look like this:

```text
[00:00:00] [nioEventLoopGroup-6-1/INFO] (SocksProxyClient) Open tunnel to remote sessionserver.mojang.com:443
[00:00:02] [nioEventLoopGroup-6-1/INFO] (SocksProxyClient) Tunnel to sessionserver.mojang.com:443 closed.
```

In addition, when DNS resolve by this mod for Minecraft server engages, there will be logs similar to this:

```text
[00:00:00] [nioEventLoopGroup-8-1/INFO] (SocksProxyClient) Open tunnel to remote dns.google:443
[00:00:00] [Server Pinger #1/INFO] (SocksProxyClient) Resolve mc.hypixel.net to 209.222.115.23
[00:00:09] [Netty Client IO #11/INFO] (SocksProxyClient) Using Socks5 proxy /127.0.0.1:1080 on 209.222.115.23/209.222.115.23:25565
```

### Aren't proxyHost and proxyPort (and proxyUser and proxyPass) game parameters sufficient?

No. In fact, they are practically useless. Minecraft will take it as a SOCKS proxy, while JDK's HTTP client wants an HTTP proxy.
The root cause lies in JDK's native implementation.

Therefore, should you take this game-parameter approach, you likely won't pass verification upon joining servers
because your genuine IP address and proxy IP address have 0 chance of matching, unless your dream server allows
proxies.

### Initial purpose of developing this mod?

Initially to satisfy my own need.
